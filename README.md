# filipino_fasttext_vectors
These are English and Filipino FastText embeddings trained on two mass media corpora (one in English, another in Filipino) from the Philippines. 

You may download the model files from http://tiny.cc/iknb001

Save the model files along with `accessing_the_vectors.py`, which contains the script for loading the models.

Consult gensim documents regarding what you can do with the models: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html


The two corpora consist of
- articles from online news sites
- song lyrics
- YouTube video titles
- government and state documents
- books
- subtitles
- web-crawled data
- religious documents


These are the embeddings used for the paper below. Kindly cite this paper if you will use the embeddings:
